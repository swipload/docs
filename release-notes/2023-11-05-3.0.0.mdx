## Features

### Shipments

Create, communicate, negotiate and get one price for multiple freight orders using a single Shipment. Order a FTL or LTL by combining multiple freight orders. A shipment can have a single or multiple pickup points and a single or multiple delivery points, and enables individual PODs for different end customers on a single shipment.

Shipments support the same features as regular freight orders, like:

- Request quote from one or many carriers
- Send to carrier as fixed price shipment
- Send to carrier as time & material pricing
- Communicate with carriers and drivers on a shipment
- Share to spot market for instant resolving of your shipment need
- Agreements, with multiple terms for your current carrier(s)
- Integrations with ERPs and TMSs

and much much more.

### Photo documentation

When signing for pickup and/or delivery you may now attach one or more photos documenting the pickup or delivery. Photos are visible for the shipper and can be presented to the end customer.

### Deviation handling

If a deviation occurs during the delivery process, you may now report it immediately, i.e. when signing for pickup or delivery. Attach photos to deviations for adding additional context and documentation.
