## Shipments

### Features

#### Shippers can now set "Base price + expenses" as a default price format for a Carrier #3007

#### Agreements will now also affect Shipment

Most importantly, Shippers will now be able to edit Freights that are a part of Shipments according to the existing agreement rule that allows changes to be made until given status. #3033

#### More information when a price is changed

Shipment log will now show what price was changed from and to. #2953

#### Easier to see which Freight orders have deviations from the POD-list #2973
