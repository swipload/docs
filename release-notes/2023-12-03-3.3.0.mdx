## Shipments

### Features

#### New pricing model for shipments: base price + expenses

With this you as the shipper can set a base price for the whole shipment and the carrier may add surcharges after delivery. This is typically used when an agreement exists between you as the shipper and your carrier. #2969

#### Carriers vehicle reference on shipments

As carrier you can specify your vehicle number/reference on assigned shipments. This is shown to the shipper and can be used for multiple properties, like display on Bill of Laden and reports. #2958

#### Add new freight order directly on shipment

In addition to merging and moving around existing freight orders on a shipment, you can now also create and add a new freight order to an existing shipment in Draft status. #2961

### Fixes

- confusing scrolling when opening a shipment. #2992
- attachments and pictures for freight orders shown on shipment for carrier. #3000

## Freight orders

### Features

#### Consignee details

In addition to delivery location you may now specify the final [consignee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consignee), your end-customer, on a freight order. Customise shipment list columns to add the consignee column and filter shipments on consignee. The consignee is displayed on the POD. #2959

#### Load quantity

You may now specify a total quantity, (i.e. number of boxes) in addition to weight, loading metre (LDM), volume, pallets and dimension on a freight order. #2901

### Changes

#### Simplify address input/updates (even simpler than before!)

Looking up a business name and location is super easy when creating a freight order, but modifying the address could be a challenge. We've now made it easy to manually change the pickup, delivery, and consignee address. #2262

### Fixes

- error sending new freight order that happened when navigating back and forth. #2900
- requirements not always shown on Draft freight order. #2913
- POD status not always updated for drivers. #2947
