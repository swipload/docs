## Shipments

### Features

#### Chat and collaborate with colleagues on shipments

When viewing a shipment in Swipload, under Messaging, you can now initiate new chat(s) with your colleagues, and view your colleagues conversations about a shipment. This is one of the most requested feature by our users, and we are certain this will help all collaborate on getting all those freights delivered on time, with even less friction! #3079

#### More data and updates made available on integrations

Endpoints for receiving data from ERP and TMS has been extended with more options, and the possibilities for when to receive outbound updates on shipments and freight orders has been improved. #3160, #3199

For questions regarding our integration options, [contact IT](https://www.swipload.com/contact-swipload) or your Swipload representative.

### Fixes

- Some links in SMS/Email notifications would not redirect to most relevant view (messages, quotes, requests). #3197
- Carriers could experience wrong content/tabs shown when browsing to a shipment from a Notification. #3165
- Multiple behind the scene improvements. #3163, #3162, #3085, #3111
