The Swipload Integrations API allows shippers and carriers to programmatically manage freight orders, shipments, and related operations within the Swipload platform.

## Key Capabilities

- **Freight Management** — Create, update, and track freight orders including status updates, document attachments, and settlement information.
- **Shipment Management** — Create shipments containing one or more freights, manage carrier settlements, and respond to shipment requests.
- **Requirements** — Retrieve the list of available freight requirements (e.g. vehicle types, equipment needs) for use when creating freights.

## Getting Started

1. Contact [Swipload Support](mailto:support@swipload.no) to obtain your API token.
2. Include the token in the `api-token` header with every request.
3. Use your own unique identifiers (`ExternalId`, `ExternalShipmentId`) to link Swipload resources back to your system.
