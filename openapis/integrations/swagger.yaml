  title: Swipload Integrations API
  description: "The Swipload Integrations API allows shippers and carriers to programmatically manage freight orders, shipments, and related operations within the Swipload platform.\n\n## Key Capabilities\n\n- **Freight Management** — Create, update, and track freight orders including status updates, document attachments, and settlement information.\n- **Shipment Management** — Create shipments containing one or more freights, manage carrier settlements, and respond to shipment requests.\n- **Requirements** — Retrieve the list of available freight requirements (e.g. vehicle types, equipment needs) for use when creating freights.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n1. Contact [Swipload Support](mailto:support@swipload.no) to obtain your API token.\n2. Include the token in the `api-token` header with every request.\n3. Use your own unique identifiers (`ExternalId`, `ExternalShipmentId`) to link Swipload resources back to your system."
